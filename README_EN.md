ðŸ“– Description

Data science project for the fictitious company Rusty Bargain, aiming to develop a machine learning model to predict used car prices based on features such as registration year, mileage, fuel type, power, etc.  
The goal is to improve pricing strategies and increase market competitiveness.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Explore and clean the data (handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers)  
- Create relevant features for the model  
- Train and compare different regression models:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - Gradient Boosting (LightGBM)  
- Evaluate models based on:
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)  
  - Training time  
  - Prediction speed  

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas / NumPy â€“ data manipulation  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn â€“ visualization  
- Scikit-learn â€“ machine learning modeling  
- LightGBM â€“ boosting for prediction  

## ðŸ“Š Results

- LightGBM showed the best performance in terms of RMSE and speed  
- Feature engineering and normalization improved predictive quality  
- The final model can be used for strategic pricing of used cars
